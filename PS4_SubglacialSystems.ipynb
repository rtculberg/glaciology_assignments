Suppose we have used an ice sheet model to determine that the average basal drag ($\\tau_b$) on this glacier 60 kPa and the average velocity due to internal ice deformation is 50 m/yr. From observations, we know that the average thickness of this glacier is 800 meters and the average surface velocity is 150 m/yr. Borehole measurements suggest this glacier sits directly on bedrock. To finalize our model, we need to choose a sliding law and tune its parameters.
