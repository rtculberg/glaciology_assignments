In Part I, you will quantitatively investigate the impact of basal roughness and basal drag on sliding speeds inferred from the Weertman sliding law. In Part II, you will use a simple example to invert for the basal friction parameter ($C$) in both the Weeterman and Budd sliding laws and explore how variations in $C$ and $m$ (the sliding exponent) impact the predicted ice velocity when the ice sheet surface geometry changes. Finally, in Part III, you will map the subglacial hydraulic potential along a glacier flowline and explore how the basal water pressure impacts the direction of flow."],"metadata":{"id":"I214Wne1i6OD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["As usual, we first need to mount our Google Drive and import some useful libraries.
