The data file LarsenCData.csv contains the following variables:

distance - distance along the flow line from highest to lowest elevation in meters
elevation - surface elevation (relative to the local geoid) in meters above local sea level
dhdt - rate of change in surface elevation along the flight line between 2010 and 2016 in meters per year
error - root mean square error in dhdt in meters per year
v - velocity in the along-flow direction along the flow line in meters per year
smb - surface mass balance along the flow line in millimeters of water equivalent per year
